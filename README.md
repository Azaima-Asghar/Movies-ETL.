# Extract, Transform, Load (ETL)

## *Project Overview*

Amazing prime video is a platform for streaming movies and TV shows on amazing prime, the world's largest online retailer.
The amazing prime team would like to develop an algorithm to predict which low budget movies being released will become popular, so that they can buy streasimg right at a bargain.

To inspire the team, have some fun and to connect with the local coding community, amazing prime has decided to sponsor a hackathon. Providing a clean dataset of movie data and asking participants to predict popular pictures.

Britta a number of amazing prime team has been asked with creating the dataset for the hackathon. There are two data sources, a Wikipedia for all movie releases since 1990 and rating data from movielens website. She will need to extract the data from the two sources, transform it into one clean dataset and finally load that dataset into a SQL table.
